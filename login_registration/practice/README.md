# Sorting

I challenged myself to write a sorting algorithm from scratch.

If you want to use my code, becareful that the "unit tests" of is sorted will fail if you change the sorting lambda!
Although the function itself is working fine, I did not write the best "unit test" for this functionality as this code is just written for my fun!

If you like, you can take care of unit tests and open a PR :D
